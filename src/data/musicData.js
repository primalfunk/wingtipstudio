        description: 'Kim Menard\'s magnum opus, the 2001 album "Intrusion of Peace", is kicked off with the titular track. Experience a sweeping journey across his musical expressions, all written and produced himself. Classic rock synths meet with the sound of the peerless Martin D-12 acoustic guitar. The album received limited radio play across different areas of the state of Texas during his life and sold a few hundred copies, which he produced with the help of a Canadian firm.',

With a length of nearly 15 minutes, this song pushes into the reaches of endurance, vividly tracing the notion of "forever" into the work in a concrete way.',

Long, expressive passages here continually reference forward to that theme, producing a meditative experience more than nine minutes long and bursting full of improvisation.',

The theme to this track reproduces the major signing number in the stage performance, but this version goes into more contemplative musical territory.

Some of his most emotively revealing work is here, where the rest of the album tends a bit further away from the gritty rock-and-roll of his younger years, never forgotten or cheaped in his eyes. Lead line from the beloved Yakima guitar, whose tone is distinct and full of fire.',

He would also incorporate things like Celtic jigs, where repetitions and patterns formed meditative spaces. This is one of those that he developed into a fuller song. ',

Few of his earliest efforts survive, but a trio of string quartets did manage to make the trip through time.

The Scherzo here is a short, repetitive piece which cycles like a dance, designed to loop itself smoothly from start to finish. This theme appears in much of Jared\'s work.',

Only the one designated "number two" survived to the present. One other understanding of this piece could be as a sort of fanfare - although, to what, it is harder to say.',

He wrote four and a half sonatas for piano, although the first was based on a musical theme suggested by one of his friends at the time, Richard Anson, and was lost to time, and the fifth was only half-finished.',

In the third sonata Jared\'s playful and meandering compositional style becomes more developed. The performance marking on this one, Allegro Cantabile, means "fast and as if singing".',

Reflecting the closeness of their musical likenesses together with the growing distance between their lives, as his son was growing a new life for himself halfway across the country, this poignant track is a beautiful rendering of the joy and pain that a father may get from a son who is more like himself than he\'d sometimes like.',

His composition, however, differs from his father\'s in other significant respects, as elements of the tonality, timing, and melody are all changed in expressive ways.

At the time, Jared saw it as a giant "fantasy" piece, which would have 12 parts, one for each of the astrological constellations. The melodies in each would have their different fluctuations determined by the positions of the physical stars themselves, adding an element of randomness to the first generative process. In the final score of that work, of the 12 which were committed to paper, only four recordings survive to date. The first of these was Gemini.',

Pisces took inspiration from several people, but in particular his wife\'s brother Jeffrey; for example, the major theme in Pisces is often given to the trombones to play, simply because Jeffrey was a skillful trombone player.',

          description: 'When writing the Sagittarius, Jared\'s mind was firmly centered around two of those in his family; his younger sister Michelle and his father, Kim. A number of his feelings for both of those beautiful people are reflected in the composition directly, including two parts which are easily identifiable. The first is the signature "hunting call" in perfect fifths of the French Horns, which appears several times in the work - this is a reference to a music effect his father loved. Secondly, the orchestration at one point renders down to a single flute line, which traces out a tender and sad melody. This is thought to reflect the love and sadness he felt for Michelle; almost ten years in age separated them, so that he had left his parent\'s house while she was a small child, and never returned for any substantial period.',

          description: 'Jared often regarded the "Scorpio" as his finest work among all the Constellations. In terms of astrology, he regarded members of that sign to be his nemesis in the world, a force counteracting him directly when he engaged in relationships with them. A lot of that fanciful attitude was only half-serious, but several major relationships with Scorpios had made a powerful impression on him. Perhaps it was that energy that went into the crafting of a delicate, ruminating melody with equal parts of sweet harmony and immense discordance. One picture which pops up many times in the piece is the archetype of flying too close to the sun, so your wax wings are melted.',

Most of the works would also experience a change in time signature, and several short "threads" of musicality were connected so that the whole, continuous piece had 23 parts. Also, he decided at this time to ditch the astrological imagery in the titling, and instead reverted to the simple names of the constellations, all of which match spatially across the western night sky.',

Jared\'s interpretation overflows uncontrollably with musical allusions to his own thoughts and feelings toward his mother, and toward motherhood in general, and as such is probably rife with material a psychoanalyst would find fascinating.

          description: 'Among all of the constellation pieces, the Crab occupies a special position. It was the first to be written, and was in character meant to resemble a "music box" effect. Jared based the majority of his emotional interpretation of this piece on his feelings for one of his life\'s best friends, Eric Brandon, who was a co-worker and roommate for many years. In mythology, Cancer was the giant crab sent by Hera to distract Hercules during his battle with the Hydra. Though crushed, Hera placed it among the stars for its efforts. Cancer symbolizes tenacity and the protective nature of the shell.',

In mythology, Draco is associated with Ladon, the dragon guarding the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides. Slain by Hercules, the dragon was placed in the sky. The constellation embodies vigilance and guardianship. The strings and winds were chosen as the primary vehicles for the first half, then brass is gradually introduced, and the new theme only emerges gradually, as the Dragon is never forced to do anything it does not wish.',

When Jared set out to write the Leo, he felt that the correct starting place was a pattern on a single drum. The rhythmic elements of this piece are expressive, more so than anywhere else, by virtue of that relationship. Linked to the Nemean Lion in Greek mythology, a fearsome beast slain by Hercules as one of his twelve labors. Hercules wore the lion\'s impenetrable skin as armor.

The only female figure among the zodiac constellations, Virgo is often associated with goddesses like Demeter or Astraea and symbolizes purity, fertility, and the harvest. The constellation highlights themes of nurturing and the cycles of nature. In practice, Jared had a few individuals to think of when he wrote the Virgo, chiefly two close friends around that time, Eric Landon Bell and Joshua Butts. The composer in this work tries to show some of the mutability and always self-refreshing nature of the sign, as comfortable with partnership as without it.',

Libra is the only inanimate object among the zodiac constellations - linked to themes of balance and justice, associations are with Themis or Astraea, goddesses of law and order. The constellation signifies equilibrium, fairness, and the weighing of souls. Though none of that ever made sense in the context of his own life, Jared never denied that he felt a little bit like an inanimate object himself sometimes.

In mythology, Scorpius was sent to kill Orion, the hunter, as retribution for his arrogance. Both were placed in the sky on opposite sides to keep them apart.

The constellation highlights exploration and philosophical inquiry. From a compositional perspective, Jared here made sure to add an acoustic guitar as several key parts, which could only refer symbolically to his father, Kim Menard, who was first and foremost a guitar player.

This version is a significant reorchestration of that piece, attempting to capture its gory, gothic heaviness with a hard rock band setting.
